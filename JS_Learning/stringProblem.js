// Sure! Here are some tricky string-related problems:

// 1. **Anagram Checker**: Write a function to determine if two strings are anagrams of each other.

// 2. **Palindrome Check**: Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

// 3. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

// 4. **String Compression**: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.

// 5. **Reverse Words in a String**: Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

// 6. **Valid Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

// 7. **Find All Anagrams in a String**: Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

// 8. **Longest Palindromic Substring**: Given a string, find the longest palindromic substring.

// 9. **Rotate String**: Given a string and an offset, rotate the string to the right by k steps.

// 10. **Edit Distance**: Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

// 11. **Group Anagrams**: Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

// 12. **Minimum Window Substring**: Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

// Remember, the difficulty of these problems can vary depending on your familiarity with string manipulation and algorithms. Start with ones that seem approachable and work your way up to the trickier ones!
